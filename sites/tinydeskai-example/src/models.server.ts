// One effect: 1.375–19.063 s of the viral TikTok Tiny Desk clip (skips the opening side view of the singer; 17.688 s, 4 shots). Same price for 1–5 people.
// The whole clip renders in one run: Kling 4.0 edit mode (Edit @video_1) replaces every person who has a photo entirely (face, hair and clothes from the photo);
// empty seats keep the original coaches. Tested: all 5 swapped 5/5, scene and cuts match the original, $3.06 at 720p, about 6 minutes.
// An earlier per-shot Seedance 2.0 mini pipeline (outfit photo edits, eye masks, 4 segments, a check per segment) was structurally fragile and was dropped.
// Assets live in R2 under assets/tinydesk/: full-17s.mp4 is that span of the viral clip as is (720×1280, 24 fps, with the song),
// used as the reference video, the original for the face check and the base clip.

 * The prompt follows the tested run: start with Edit @video_1 (written as Reference it becomes reference-to-video), replace each person,
 * then keep motion, expressions, lip sync, camera, cuts and duration frame by frame. The engine names images @image1; Kling 4.0 wants @image_1 and Yir rejects the wrong name.
 * The stage starts with 5 dogs, so a photo may be a person or a dog and the server cannot tell; the prompt says "person or animal".
 * The animal sentence and "no lead singer or new character in the band shots" come from the tested dog run: without them a second lead appears and hands stay human.
 * A mix of people and dogs in one job is untested.
