          `Tiny Desk AI Generator makes the viral "Outstanding" Tiny Desk AI video: the end of Charlie Wilson's 2023 NPR Tiny Desk performance of The Gap Band's "Outstanding", as cut on TikTok (band, big laugh close-up, sax solo, band again). Swap any 1 to 5 band members (lead vocals, sax, keys, two backing singers) for anyone (this week's losing coaches, players, celebrities, friends or yourself): tap a band member, add one photo each; spots you leave alone keep the coaches from the viral video. Output: an about 18-second vertical 9:16 MP4 at 720p with the original song plus a silent copy, no watermark, rendered with Kuaishou Kling 4.0 in edit mode in about 7 to 10 minutes. Price: $9.98 per video for 1 to 5 people; packs of 3 for $24.99 and 10 for $59.99; one-time payment, credits never expire, failed videos refund automatically; no free renders. Sign in with Google or email before paying. Photos are deleted within 2 days. Independent fan tool for parody videos, not affiliated with NPR, Tiny Desk Concerts, Charlie Wilson or The Gap Band.`,
