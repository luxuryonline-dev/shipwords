# Tiny Desk AI design direction

- **Audience**: people coming from the TikTok "Outstanding" meme who want to put a coach, a rival team, a favorite player, friends or themselves at the desk, then post the clip to TikTok and group chats. Not NPR Tiny Desk listeners, so nothing quiet or arty.
- **Mood**: live footage first, with a bit of gig-poster playfulness. Real frames are the hero and text only explains them; warm, not cold or techy.
- **Fonts**: headings Fraunces (heavy serif); short poster labels (crew names, section tags, ticket stubs) Anton, uppercase, never for sentences or the H1; body Instrument Sans; hard numbers (price, duration, seats) JetBrains Mono.
- **Colors**: stage black `#0f0c0a`, panel `#1a1511`; cream text `#efe7da`; stage-light amber `#f2a33a` for primary buttons and emphasis; record red `#e5483a` only for small accents like `● REC`; poster paper `#efe6d2` with ink `#1d1712`. Dividers are cream at 12% opacity.
- **Texture**: a faint film grain on dark sections; sample clips are muted, autoplay, loop, `object-fit: cover`, 14px radius; dark and poster-paper sections alternate with generous spacing.
- **Home first screen**: left, a `● REC` tag, a large serif H1, one subtitle and the generator (stage photo); right, a 9:16 sample card with a three-option pill above it, "Dogs / The viral original / Made here" (selected one amber): it defaults to our dog version (five AI-generated dogs; every competitor shows people, so pets set us apart) and can switch to the top viral TikTok or a real all-five-swapped output (AI-generated faces, said under the card). The stage follows the switch, so on load it shows the dogs like the sample. All three share one player, and the sound toggle survives the switch. The card has a crew tag, a one-line hook and a mono stat or how it was made. On mobile: title, sample, generator. The generate button is always enabled: with no photo of your own yet it opens the lead's file picker; without the consent box ticked it highlights the box. Below: a wall of three vertical sample cards, then a row of the four shots (band, lead laughing, sax, band finale), each labelled with its timestamp and who is swapped.
- **Avoid**: NPR branding in the site's own identity (logo, red and black, Tiny Desk wordmark); blue primary buttons, purple gradients and glassmorphism; neon yellow on black and all-caps outlined headlines; the template's light grey background.

## Components

- **Sample card (first screen)**: 9:16, no rotation or white border, thin outline and a large shadow. Anton crew tag top left, a mono strip at the bottom: `sample · AI cast · about 18 s · 720p`.
- **Shot strip**: four small vertical samples side by side (horizontal scroll on mobile), each with a mono timestamp, shot name and who is swapped.
- **Upload stage**: no vertical upload boxes. No single frame shows all five musicians, so the stage is a three-frame collage `public/media/stage.jpg`: band wide shot on the left (back left, back right, keys), lead close-up top right, sax bottom right. Each face gets a dashed amber ring slot with a small "+" badge; slot coordinates are `SEATS` in `tool.tsx` and must be re-measured if the image changes. The stage follows the hero switch: on "Made here" it fades in `stage-ours.jpg` and on "Dogs" `stage-dogs.jpg` (same moments and crop from each output, same slot coordinates), each on its own layer above and preloaded so only the opacity changes.
  - The five seats start with the faces of the five dogs from the dog version; at least one photo of your own is needed to order. Tap a musician to upload their photo; the face then sits on that musician with a small ×: on your photo it puts the dog back, on a dog it keeps the original coach. Swapped faces can be dragged to another seat (an empty seat moves it, a filled seat swaps them; the target grows and gets a cream and amber ring; dropping outside cancels). On desktop an image file can be dropped straight onto a musician. Names are short mono labels (Lead, Sax, Keys, Back left, Back right).
  - Under the stage, one amber mono status line that updates live: `swapped 2/5 · whole video in one go · $9.98`.
  - Above the stage, three presets (Just me on lead / Whole band / Back row only) that highlight seats and open the first empty one; nothing is forced.
  - Below the stage, a note that × puts the dog back and × on a dog keeps the coach, a consent box (rights to the photos, everyone 18+, it's a parody), and the price on the button.
  - Mobile works the same way, with a minimum face size and short names so labels don't overlap.
- **Generating**: three steps of copy (`Setting the stage` → `Swapping in your lead` → `Final mix`) with an estimated wait in mono. No fake percentages.
- **Result**: two download buttons (with the song, silent) and a line: if TikTok mutes it, post the silent version and add "Outstanding" from the sound library.
- **Pricing cards**: three tiers side by side, the featured one with an amber outline and an Anton tag. Below, "Before you pay": the AI result looks like the person but not identical; failures refund credits automatically; one-time payment, no subscription.
- **Sample captions**: "Made from an AI-generated photo" or "Reference clip, not a live result".
- **Crew line-up**: not equal-sized cards but a gig-poster line-up: one crew per row, big Anton name (amber on odd rows), a one-line description on the right, thin dividers.
- **Content pages** (tutorial, template, guides): long poster-paper cards, `#efe6d2` with a faint halftone, ink text, serif headings, Anton tags, mono tables.

## Optional scenery control

- Keep the existing homepage sections and photo stage. Add a compact, closed-by-default “Scenery” disclosure between phone upload and consent.
- Default to the original room. Inside the disclosure, use a labelled select for original scenery, three preset environments and a custom description. Only the custom selection reveals a short textarea.
- Use the existing dark panel, cream type and amber focus styling. Controls span the available width and stay usable on mobile. Show a short note that changed scenery can affect small visual details; do not show model names, prompts or infrastructure settings.
- Preserve the selected scenery and description through sign-in, reload and checkout in the same browser session.

## Domain brand identity

- The brand for tinydeskaigenerator.org is Tiny Desk AI Generator. Match the site name, homepage brand mentions and logo assets to that name.
- Use the original amber desk/audio/play mark for the logo and browser icons. Preserve the existing layout, copy concept, examples, pricing, feature claims and generator behavior.
